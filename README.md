Clevert, Djork-Arné, Thomas Unterthiner, and Sepp Hochreiter. "Fast and accurate deep network learning by exponential linear units (elus)." arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.07289 (2015).


1. Please install jupyter notebook if not already present.
2. Run 'CSE 569 Exponential Linear Unit.ipynb'.
3. Different activation functions are written in different blocks. Run the particular block and change the line in the 'model' method (Comment can be found in the method) to run a particular network.
4. Cross-Entropy Graph can be recreated by running all 4 networks.
5. ~96 % accuracy with a six-layer network (ELU) on the MNIST dataset.
